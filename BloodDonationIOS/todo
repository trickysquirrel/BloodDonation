============
todo
============

On app start first time ask user for Blood type
If user has selected blood type ask for location
Then display a confirmation screen with blood type and location on selection
    . generate a topic and au/vic/eltham/o+
    . inform user if they have already registered elsewhere - remove previous one topic and data base
    . register topic
    . save blood type and location


On app start when user has already selected blood type but not location, ask for location
On app start when user has already selected blood and location but not send notification, send notification
On app start when user has already registered notifications just show the current choices they have already selected
Allow user to change blood type and location
On app start if the user is blocking notifications let them know to change it in settings
Ask user if its ok to send some data about blood type and location so information can be used to figure out what kind of notification to send
On receiving a silent notification, check for blood type and location, if its a match then generate local notification with the correct localisation text from app not server.
On reciving a valid notification, add to notification list for view to see later
